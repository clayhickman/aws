[The Five Elements of Cloud Computing]

- On-Demand Self-Service
    - Provision and Terminate using a UI/CLI without human interaction

- Broad Network Access
    - Access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods

- Resource Pooling
    - Economies of scale, cheaper service

- Rapid Elasticity
    - Scale UP (OUT) and DOWN (IN) automatically in response to system load

- Measured Service
    - Usage is measured. Pay for what you consume

[Different Clouds]

- Public Cloud
    - Using ONE public cloud

- Private Cloud
    - Using one premises “REAL” cloud

- Multi-Cloud
    - Using MORE THAN ONE public cloud

- Hybrid Cloud
    - Public and Private clouds
    - Hybrid Cloud is NOT public cloud + legacy on-premises
        - This would be known as a Hybrid Network / Environment

[Cloud Service Models]

- Infrastructure Stack
    - A collection of things that application needs, all stacked onto each other
        - Application > Data > Runtime > Container > OS > Virtualization > Servers > Infrastructure > Facilities
    - Parts YOU manage
    - Parts managed by the VENDOR
    - Unit of consumption
        - It’s what you pay for an consume
        - It’s the part of the system where from that point upwards in the infrastructure stack you are responsible for management

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
    - The provider manages the facilities, infrastructure, servers and virtualization
    - You manage the OS, container, runtime, data and application

- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
    - Your unit of consumption is the runtime environment, application and data
    - The provider manages everything else

- SaaS (Software as a Service)
    - Your unit of consumption is the application
    - The provider manages everything else
